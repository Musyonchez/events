with the dark blue and yellow been primary white to balance and the light purple or so can be ignored in most cases but still relevtant

make it look godly plus mobile responsive
plus i olso like this thing of the script tag been within the section
i find it good as modularization is not good in html there for editing is easier

const user = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("user"));
if (user) {
  console.log("Logged in as:", user.full_name); // adjust based on your user structure
}
