// This file will handle the email verification process for new user registrations.
// It will likely involve:
// 1. Generating a unique verification token upon user registration.
// 2. Sending an email to the user with a link containing this token.
// 3. Verifying the token when the user clicks the link to activate their account.
// This will be tackled together with email notifications.
