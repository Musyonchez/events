<?php
// This file will handle the password reset process.
// It will likely involve:
// 1. Receiving a request to reset password (e.g., via email).
// 2. Generating a unique, time-limited token.
// 3. Sending an email to the user with a link containing this token.
// 4. Verifying the token when the user clicks the link.
// 5. Allowing the user to set a new password.
// This will be tackled when implementing email notifications.
